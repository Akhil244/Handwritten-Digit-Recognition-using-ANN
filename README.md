Description : Handwriting Digit Recognition Using ANN(Artificial Neural Network)


1. To run and test the code:
   python Digits.py

2. To predict images to test quickly and it will used the trained results:
   that were save into pickle files.
   python DigitLoadPickle.py

3. To train a new and save the results from training:
   python DigitStoreToPickle.py
