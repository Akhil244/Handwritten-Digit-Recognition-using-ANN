# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

This mini-project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) **from scratch** (using only **NumPy** and basic math — no TensorFlow or PyTorch) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Neural network built from the ground up (no external ML libraries).
- Save and load trained models using Python's `pickle`.
- Test and predict digits quickly with saved models.

## Project Files
- **Digits.py** — Run and test the model.
- **DigitStoreToPickle.py** — Train a new model and save the trained weights to a pickle file.
- **DigitLoadPickle.py** — Load a previously saved model and predict/test digits quickly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing samples)

Install dependencies if needed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
